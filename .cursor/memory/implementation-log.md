# Implementation Log

## Phase 1: WebView+Native Framework Library (B) - ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
- ✅ Create WebUI.Framework class library project
- ✅ Add WebView2 NuGet package
- ✅ Implement WebView management (IWebViewHost, WebViewHost, WebViewOptions)
- ✅ Implement native window handling (WindowHelper - simplified)
- ✅ Create common utilities for both Control App and Host processes

### Completed Components
- **IWebViewHost**: Interface for WebView management
- **WebViewHost**: Main implementation with initialization, navigation, script execution, host objects
- **WebViewOptions**: Configuration options for WebView instances
- **WindowHelper**: Simple utilities for functionality Windows Forms doesn't provide well

### Features Implemented
- WebView2 integration with full configuration options and latest API compatibility
- Simple window utilities (tool window, drag-to-move, floating toolbar setup)
- Host object management for C# ↔ JavaScript interop
- Event handling for WebView lifecycle

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **Fixed WebView2 API compatibility** - Updated to use modern constructor-based approach
- ✅ **Removed over-engineering** - Simplified NativeWindowManager (260+ lines) to WindowHelper (80 lines)
- ✅ **Uses Windows Forms features** - Only implements what Forms doesn't provide well

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Compilation**: Successful (minor warnings only)
- ⏳ **Integration Testing**: Ready to test with Control App
- ⏳ **Basic WebView Test**: Need to create simple HTML test

## Phase 2: C# ↔ WebView Bridge Library (A) - READY TO START

### Goals
#### Part 1: The Bridge
- ⏳ Create simple `send()` / `on()` pattern abstraction
- ⏳ JSON message passing (abstracted from developer)
- ⏳ Bi-directional communication

#### Part 2: Core APIs using the Bridge
- ⏳ File System API (`fs`) - file operations for extensions
- ⏳ I/O API (`io`) - general input/output operations  
- ⏳ IPC API (`ipc`) - inter-plugin communication system

### Current Status
- **Previous**: Phase 1 completed successfully
- **Current**: Ready to test Phase 1 integration before starting Phase 2
- **Next**: Test WebViewHost integration with Control App, then start Bridge Library
