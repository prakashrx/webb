- [ ] **5.5** Create CSS styling for panel chrome and layout

**Dependencies:** Task 2 (JS API), Task 4 (Extension Loader)  
**Output:** Working panel container with chrome UI

---

## Task 6: Core Main Toolbar Extension
**Goal:** Svelte extension that provides extension loading UI

- [ ] **6.1** Create core.main-toolbar manifest.json and folder structure
- [ ] **6.2** Build MainToolbar.svelte component with extension loading UI
- [ ] **6.3** Implement extension loading form (URL input, load button)
- [ ] **6.4** Add extension management UI (loaded extensions list, unload functionality)
- [ ] **6.5** Integrate with extension loader via IPC messaging

**Dependencies:** Task 2 (JS API), Task 4 (Extension Loader)  
**Output:** Working main toolbar with extension management

---

## Task 7: Test Extension
**Goal:** Complete user extension with HTTP serving and live reload

- [ ] **7.1** Create test extension folder structure with manifest.json
- [ ] **7.2** Build TestPanel.svelte component with sample functionality
- [ ] **7.3** Set up Vite dev server configuration for extension serving
- [ ] **7.4** Create panel.html entry point with webui-api.js integration
- [ ] **7.5** Test extension loading via main toolbar UI
- [ ] **7.6** Test panel creation and IPC communication

**Dependencies:** Task 5 (Panel Container), Task 6 (Main Toolbar)  
**Output:** Working test extension demonstrating full workflow

---

## Task 8: End-to-End Testing
**Goal:** Comprehensive validation of complete system

- [ ] **8.1** Test complete extension loading workflow (core + user extensions)
- [ ] **8.2** Validate panel creation, chrome rendering, and iframe isolation
- [ ] **8.3** Test IPC messaging between extensions and core system
- [ ] **8.4** Test extension lifecycle (load, unload, reload) and error handling
- [ ] **8.5** Performance testing and optimization of WebView2 + extension system
- [ ] **8.6** Create comprehensive test documentation and examples

**Dependencies:** Task 7 (Test Extension)  
**Output:** Production-ready POC with full documentation

## Quick Progress Summary

### Completed Tasks: 0/8 Major Tasks (0/38 Subtasks)
### Current Focus: Task 1 - HostApiBridge (COM Interface)
### Next Milestone: JavaScript API integration

### Key Deliverables Status:
- [ ] COM Bridge (C# ‚ü∑ JavaScript)
- [ ] Extension Loading System
- [ ] Panel Container with Chrome
- [ ] Main Toolbar with Extension UI
- [ ] Test Extension with HTTP Serving
- [ ] Complete End-to-End Workflow

---

## Notes & Decisions
- Using UUID-based handlers for thread safety instead of string-based
- Iframe isolation for proper development workflow
- Core extensions loaded from disk, user extensions from HTTP
- Extension identity passed via query parameters
- Central IPC routing through workbench for cross-extension communication
